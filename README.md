## Introduction to C

C is a powerful and widely-used programming language known for its efficiency and versatility. This section provides an overview of C and guides you through setting up your development environment.

### What is C?

Learn about the origins and characteristics of the C programming language. Understand why C remains relevant and widely used in various domains, from system programming to application development.

### Key Features and Advantages

Explore the features that make C a preferred language for many developers. From low-level memory manipulation to high-level abstractions, discover the strengths of C.

### Syntax and Structure

Understand the basic syntax rules and structure of C programs. Learn how to write simple programs and organize your code effectively.

### Variables and Data Types

Explore the various data types in C, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more. Learn how to declare and use variables efficiently.

### Control Flow Statements

Master the control flow statements, including conditional statements (if, else), loops (while, for), and switch statements. Learn how to control the flow of your program's execution.

## Functions and Modular Programming

C promotes modular programming through functions, allowing you to write modular and reusable code. This section introduces you to the concept of functions and how they contribute to code organization.

### Function Declaration and Definition

Understand how to declare and define functions in C. Explore the importance of function prototypes for modular code development.

### Parameter Passing

Learn about parameter passing in C functions, including pass by value and pass by reference. Explore how functions can communicate and share data.

Discover the principles of modular programming in C. Understand how to organize your code into functions and modules for maintainability and reusability.

## Pointers and Memory Management

Efficient memory management is a crucial aspect of C programming. This section covers pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and common pitfalls.

### Understanding Pointers

Master the concept of pointers in C, including pointer arithmetic and manipulation. Explore how pointers contribute to efficient memory access.

### Dynamic Memory Allocation

Learn about dynamic memory allocation in C using functions like `malloc` and `free`. Understand the importance of managing memory dynamically.

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

Identify common pitfalls in pointer manipulation and memory management. Explore best practices to avoid memory leaks and undefined behavior.

## File Handling in C

File handling is a fundamental aspect of many C applications. This section introduces you to reading and writing files in C and handling file I/O operations.

### Reading and Writing Files

Understand how to open, read, and write files in C. Learn about file streams and the basic operations for file handling.

### File I/O Operations
