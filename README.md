Welcome to the world of C programming! This README serves as an introduction and guide to getting started with the C programming language.

## What is C?

C is a powerful and widely-used programming language known for its efficiency, flexibility, and portability. Developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, C has since become one of the most popular and influential programming languages in the world.

## Features of C:

- **Procedural Language**: C is a procedural programming language, which means it follows a top-down approach for executing program instructions.
  
- **Efficiency**: C is known for its high performance and efficiency. It provides low-level access to memory and hardware, allowing developers to write code that executes quickly and uses system resources efficiently.

- **Portability**: C programs can be easily ported across different platforms and operating systems with minimal changes. This makes C an ideal choice for writing system software and applications that need to run on various environments.

- **Rich Standard Library**: C comes with a rich standard library that provides a wide range of functions for performing common tasks such as input/output operations, string manipulation, memory management, and mathematical computations.

- **Extensibility**: C supports modular programming through the use of functions and libraries.

## Getting Started:

To start programming in C, you'll need a C compiler installed on your system. Here are some popular C compilers:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection): Available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Clang: Another open-source compiler available for multiple platforms.
- Visual Studio: Microsoft's integrated development environment (IDE) for Windows includes a C compiler.

Once you have a compiler installed, you can write your C code in a text editor and save it with a `.c` extension. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
