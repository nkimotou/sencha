## Introduction to C

C is a powerful and widely-used programming language known for its efficiency and versatility. This section provides an overview of C and guides you through setting up your development environment.

### What is C?

Learn about the origins and characteristics of the C programming language. Understand why C remains relevant and widely used in various domains, from system programming to application development.

### Key Features and Advantages

Explore the features that make C a preferred language for many developers. From low-level memory manipulation to high-level abstractions, discover the strengths of C.

### Syntax and Structure

Understand the basic syntax rules and structure of C programs. Learn how to write simple programs and organize your code effectively.

### Variables and Data Types

Explore the various data types in C, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more. Learn how to declare and use variables efficiently.

### Control Flow Statements

Master the control flow statements, including conditional statements (if, else), loops (while, for), and switch statements. Learn how to control the flow of your program's execution.

## Functions and Modular Programming

C promotes modular programming through functions, allowing you to write modular and reusable code. This section introduces you to the concept of functions and how they contribute to code organization.

### Function Declaration and Definition

Understand how to declare and define functions in C. Explore the importance of function prototypes for modular code development.

### Parameter Passing

Learn about parameter passing in C functions, including pass by value and pass by reference. Explore how functions can communicate and share data.

### Modular Code Organization

Discover the principles of modular programming in C. Understand how to organize your code into functions and modules for maintainability and reusability.

## Pointers and Memory Management

Efficient memory management is a crucial aspect of C programming. This section covers pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and common pitfalls.

### Understanding Pointers

Master the concept of pointers in C, including pointer arithmetic and manipulation. Explore how pointers contribute to efficient memory access.

### Dynamic Memory Allocation

Learn about dynamic memory allocation in C using functions like `malloc` and `free`. Understand the importance of managing memory dynamically.

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

Identify common pitfalls in pointer manipulation and memory management. Explore best practices to avoid memory leaks and undefined behavior.

## File Handling in C

File handling is a fundamental aspect of many C applications. This section introduces you to reading and writing files in C and handling file I/O operations.

### Reading and Writing Files

Understand how to open, read, and write files in C. Learn about file streams and the basic operations for file handling.

### File I/O Operations
